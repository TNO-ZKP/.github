The TNO PET Lab is a cross-project initiative initiated to improve the overall
quality, generality, and reusability in the development of Privacy-Enhancing
Technologies (PET) solutions developed in the numerous (past, ongoing, and
future) TNO projects that involve PET. It consists of generic software
components, procedures, and functionalities developed and maintained on a
regular basis to facilitate and aid in the development of PET solutions. The lab
strives to boost the development of new protocols and solutions, and decrease
time-to-market.

## Technologies

Within the TNO PET Lab we work with various privacy-enhancing technologies. For
the sake of structure, every technology is bundled in its own GitHub
organisation.

| Technology                           | GitHub organisation                    | PyPI                                                |

## Open Source

We believe that opening up the mysteries of advanced cryptography benefits
society. Conform the Kerckhoff’s principle the security of the developed MPC
solutions does not rely on secrecy but on mathematical principles. The TNO MPC
Lab supports Kerckhoff’s principle by publishing open source as a way to
validate the theoretical/mathematical correctness of cryptographic protocols as
well as their implementations.

The mostly used license for TNO PET Lab components is the Apache License,
Version 2.0. This allows for easy adoption and flexible usage without enforcing
a specific license to (end-)users and contributors of the codebase. We are
always open to questions on, suggestions for and contributions to our codebase.
